Improved proof of existence sample

## Project Summary (3-5 lines overview of the team's project)

The goal is to create a proof of concept that can be used for 
- Document validation by email, OTP, via Blockchain (similar to https://app.thepaybox.biz/)

- Updating claim 
- Updating lock (this will be later improved )
- Frontend in react is improved to simulate working

- The image shows updated claim
- Lock entered
- Full lock feature is still not working as expected. (we are freshers in rust and react)
- Will improve
