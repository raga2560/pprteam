- PPR TEAM 

(Hackathon project)

## Project Title

Improved proof of existence sample

## Project Summary (3-5 lines overview of the team's project)

### Description

The goal is to create a proof of concept that can be used for document validation. We already have a app using DASH. We need to port it to substrate framework.

For this purpose we are creating proof of concept.


By doing this applications can certify on blockchain like below

This has document validation by email, OTP, via Blockchain 

It requires P2SH type of locking.

- The effort is in that direction

After implementing, the ported application will run on substrate framework, in selendra blockchain.

The complete scope of usage looks like below

### Achieved

- Claiming document hash (already existed in POE sample)
- Updating claim 
- Updating lock (this will be later improved )
- Frontend in react is improved to simulate working
